abstract = {We report analyses of hydrogen abundance in experimentally annealed and natural mantle minerals using FTIR and use these data to establish calibration lines for measurement of H(2)O concentrations in olivine, pyroxenes, garnet, amphibole and mica by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). We have reduced the detection limit for H(2)O analysis by SIMS to 2-4 ppm H(2)O (by weight) through careful attention to sample preparation and vacuum quality. The accuracy of the SIMS calibrations depends on the choice of FTIR extinction coefficients; however, all of the calibrations reported here are shown to be consistent with measurements on standards whose H(2)O abundance has been determined independently via manometry or nuclear reaction analysis. The resulting calibrations are accurate to 10-30{\%} at the 95{\%} confidence limit, with improvements possible through the use of higher-H(2)O standards. Using our SIMS calibration, we determined hydrogen concentrations in coexisting olivine, orthopyroxene, and glass from a single melting experiment at 2 GPa and 1380degreesC. Olivine/melt and orthopyroxene/melt partition coefficients are equal to 0.0020+/-0.0002 and 0.0245+/-0.0015, respectively, and the orthopyroxene/olivine coefficient is 12+/-4 (2sigma uncertainties).},

@article{Kovacs2012,
abstract = {The incorporation of water in olivine and pyroxenes interlayered within fertile lherzolite compositions was explored experimentally near the wet solidus of lherzolite at 2{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4 GPa. The concentrations and activities of water were varied to establish the partitioning of water between nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) and the hydrous minerals pargasite and phlogopite. The water content in NAMs was determined by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The main absorption bands in NAMs from these experiments are very similar to those generally found in natural upper mantle peridotites. Olivine, orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene contain 32–190, 290–320 and 910–980 ppm of water under the studied conditions. The partition coefficients between coexisting clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene (Dcpx/opx) are 2{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 1{\textperiodcentered}1 and 3{\textperiodcentered}5 ± 1{\textperiodcentered}5 at 2{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4 GPa respectively, whereas values for coexisting orthopyroxene and olivine (Dopx/ol) are 6{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 2 and 4{\textperiodcentered}7 ± 1{\textperiodcentered}1, at 2{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4 GPa respectively. The storage capacity in NAMs in a model mantle composition close to the vapour-saturated solidus (water-rich vapour) is ∼190 ppm at both 2{\textperiodcentered}5 and 4 GPa. Pargasite is the most important phase accommodating significant amounts of water in the uppermost mantle. Its breakdown with increasing pressure at 3 GPa at the vapour-saturated solidus (which is at ∼1025°C at 2{\textperiodcentered}5 GPa) results in a sharp drop in the water storage capacity of peridotite from ∼1000 ppm to ∼190 ppm H2O. At pressures {\textgreater}3 GPa, melting in fertile lherzolite begins at the vapour-saturated solidus if the bulk H2O concentration exceeds ∼190 ppm.},
